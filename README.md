Project: Movie Recommendation System

Description:
Build a movie recommendation system that allows users to get personalized movie recommendations based on their preferences. The system should have the following components:

Data Storage:

Implement a database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB, or SQLite) to store movie information, such as title, genre, release year, director, and ratings.
Populate the database with a sufficient number of movies.
User Interface:

Design and implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing or JavaFX to interact with the system.
Include features such as login/registration, search functionality, and displaying movie recommendations.
User Management:

Allow users to create accounts and log in to the system.
Implement user authentication and authorization to ensure secure access.
Recommendation Engine:

Develop a recommendation engine that suggests movies based on user preferences.
Consider using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a hybrid approach.
Display the recommended movies based on the user's profile.
Integration:

Integrate the user interface, data storage, and recommendation engine components to work together seamlessly.
Implement appropriate APIs or interfaces to communicate between these components.
Error Handling and Validation:

Implement robust error handling and validation mechanisms to handle incorrect user input and system failures gracefully.
Ensure data integrity and security throughout the application.
Documentation and Testing:

Provide clear documentation on how to set up and run the application.
Write unit tests to ensure the functionality of individual components.
Test the entire application to ensure proper integration and functionality.
